# Welcome to the lab on enabling GitHub Pages!

### About the codebase
The codebase contains a starter GitHub pages site, but you can use any content you'd like as long as the conditions below are met. 

A grading script and a setup utility exist inside of the `.github` directory. You do not need to use these workflows for any purpose and altering their contents will affect the repository's ability to assess your lab and give feedback.

### Lab instructions
To successfully complete this lab, the following conditions must be met:
- GitHub Pages must be enabled
- The GitHub Pages site must use the `main` branch as the source
- The GitHub Pages site must use the `docs/` directory as the source
